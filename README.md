In this project, I look to analyze the effect of weather on covid19 cases. Analysis is focused on states in the United States and daily data is collected.

`wrangle_act.ipynb` contains code for the wragling act done on the data, from gathering to accessing and then to cleaning. 

I didn't want to use a big data framework because I didn't consider the data to be a big data. Daily data collection started from January 2020 to March 2022 which would give us about `790 rows` of data for each state. Multiplying 790 by 50 states gives about 39,500 rows of information.

However, I did perform my analysis on snowflake because I wanted to practice using the tool.
